Application
Application reads in a set of 2000 grades into a two-dimensional array from a .txt file called studentanswers that represent the results from a test of 20 true-false questions for 100 students. Each row of the array represents the answers of one of the 100 students in the class. Each column represents the answers of each student to a specific question on the test. Each cell of the array contains either the Boolean value “true” or “false.” The Application reads in the values from a second .txt file called questionanswers to be stored in a second one-dimensional array of 20 Boolean values that represent the correct answers to the 20 questions. The Application/program computes and prints out the number of correct answers for each student in chart form, the number of students who got each of the 20 questions correct in chart form, the average quiz grade and the standard deviation of the grades.
